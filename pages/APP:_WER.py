        #### Interpreting WER Results
        
        - **0% WER**: Indicates perfect accuracy, with the recognized text exactly matching the reference.
        - **Low WER (5% to 20%)**: High accuracy, with few errors relative to the number of words. The transcription is generally reliable.
        - **Moderate WER (20% to 50%)**: Moderate accuracy, noticeable errors that may affect understanding of certain parts of the text.
        - **High WER (over 50%)**: Poor accuracy, significant errors likely make the transcription unreliable without extensive corrections.
        
        The lower the WER, the better the performance of the speech recognition system. A high WER may suggest issues with audio quality, speaker's pronunciation, or the complexity of the language used.
