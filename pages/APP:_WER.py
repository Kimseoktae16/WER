    #### üîë Interpreting WER Results
    
    - **0% WER**: Indicates perfect accuracy, with the recognized text exactly matching the reference.
    - **Low WER (5% to 20%)**: High accuracy, with few errors relative to the number of words. The transcription is generally reliable.
    - **Moderate WER (20% to 50%)**: Moderate accuracy, noticeable errors that may affect understanding of certain parts of the text.
    - **High WER (over 50%)**: Poor accuracy, significant errors likely make the transcription unreliable without extensive corrections.
    
    ‚ùó_Note:_The lower the WER, the better the performance of the speech recognition system. A high WER may suggest issues with audio quality, speaker's pronunciation, or the complexity of the language used.
